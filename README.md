# Mushroom-Toxicity-Identification (WIP)
A term project on the classification of toxicity of mushrooms using computer vision.

In this project, traditional MLP and CNN implementations (blocks are written explicitly) are investigated. 

Different data preprocessing methods are also looked at to determine their effects on the models.
