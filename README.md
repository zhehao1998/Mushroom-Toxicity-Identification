# Mushroom-Toxicity-Identification
A term project on the classification of toxicity of mushrooms using computer vision.

In this project, traditional MLP and CNN implementations are investigated. 
- All convolution layers are defined explicitly

Different data preprocessing methods are also looked at to determine their effects on the models.
- Denoising using croping
- RGB vs Grayscale
- Scale jittering
